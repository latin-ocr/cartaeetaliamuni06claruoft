Robert Grevile, Lord Brooke, was second son of the Lord Brooke who was killed at Lichfield. He
married Anu, daughter of John Doddington, of Brymer, Hants, and coheir of Edward her brother. Lord
Brooke died 17th Feb„ 1676, leaving two daughters—Anu, who married William, Earl of Kingston3 and
Doddington. who married Charles, Duke of Manchester. Lady Brook then married Thomas Hoby. The
other co-heir, Catherine Doddington, married Peregrine Hoby, of Bisham‚ and had issue.

The Glamorgan property came in by the marriage of Sir William Doddington‚ Edward’s grandfather,
to Mary, daughter and heiress of Sir John Herbert of Neath Abbey. Dinas Powis was probably sold by
Anne's children. Neath Abbey‚ specially left to the Hobys, remains in their descendants in the female

line.
Philip Herbert, the seneschal‚ was probably of Oogan Vach, the son of Edward Herbert, by Elizabeth,

daughter of Gabriel Lewis ot* Llanishen.
Who Catherine St. John was is uncertain. Her husband was certainly of the Highlight family3 but

the mother of Oliver St. John of Highlight, living in 1761, was Elizabeth Bawdripp.

Edward Lewis was of Van, Boarstal‚ and Brill. The two latter estates in Oxfordshire and Bucking-
hamshire‚ went to his sister: Van, the ancestral seat, to his uncle, Richard Lewis, of Edington, Wilts,
whose granddaughter‚ Elizabeth Lewis, carried it to her husband, Other, third Earl of Plymouth,
ancestor of the Earl of Plymouth, the present owner of Van.

william Fleming of Flemingston or Flimston, seems to have been the last of that ancient family.

Sir Baynham F'rogmorton or Throgmorton was of Gloucestershire. The earliest connexion of the
family with Glamorgan was by a match with an heiress of David of Radyr. The Mackworths came in by

a marriage with an heiress of Evans of Grnoll.
This document has considerable local value, as it fixes certain points in the deseent of the manor of

Dinas Powis.
