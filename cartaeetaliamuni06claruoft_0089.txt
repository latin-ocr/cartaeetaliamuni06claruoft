The manor, long the designation employed in the describing of lauded estates, has now fallen com-
pletely into disuse. It is, however, valuable for early topographical and genealogical purposes, and is for
that reason included in these volumes whenever it can be recorded.

The Manor of Kegerwen or angerwen occupies the northern two-thirds of the parish of Llangiwg, aud
forms the north-eastern part of Glamorgan. Its boundaries to the west, north-west and north are those
of both the parish and county. They are, to the west the Gwrnant down to its junction with the Aman,
to the north from that junction up to the head waters of the Aman, whence, after the intervention of a
narrow strip of highland, the eastern boundary is the upper part of the Twrch river, down to where, at a
narrow neck of a loop of the river, it ceases for a few yards to be the parish boundary, and that of the
manor passes irregularly westwards to form its southern boundary until it joins the Llynfell brook and
following the course of the Nant·y-Gaseg to its junction with the Gwrnant.

The lord’s demesne lands are considerable, tenants generally hold by the verge or rod, and are subject to ⁴
a heriot of the best beast, or failing that, of five shillings. These tenures are called ‘customary,' but they
are in fact ‘copyhold.' The boundaries are very closely described, but the names of places are often
personal, and are in most cases irretrievably lost.

There were two Courts Leet, and ten Courts Baron held annually‚ the officers were the steward, the

bailiff or beadle who collected the lord’s rents, and the constable. All the names of the tenants, and indeed
with the exception of the lord, all the persons mentioned in the survey are Welsh.

The places named as boundaries that can be identified are the rivers Aman and Twrch 3 me Llynfell‚
the Llynfess3 Nant-y-Gaseg and Garnant brooks.

Of the holdings named, a few may be identified3 such are Pant-y-Bara‚ Coed-y-ffali now Coed-y-ffaldau‚
me-nant Hopkin‚ Tir-yn-y-gors now Tyddyn-cwm-y-gorS‚ Blaen-y-nant, Gwaun-cae·Gurwen‚ Bryn-y-
llefrith‚ Ynayadd Wen now Neuadc1, Maerdy Rhys, me bach, and Bryn du.
