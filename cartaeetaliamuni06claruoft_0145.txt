To the WPfull and muoh Worthy Gent.
WILLIAM HERBERT of OoeAN-PILL
Esquire these.

(1) The letters after ‘T' rubbed aw ay. The next word seems to be ‘offences’ This is
probably the work entitled: ‘A treatise of treasons against Queen Elizabeth and

{he Croune of England' [Paris ?] 1572, attributed to Sir William Cecil. Black
etter. 8vo.

(3) Illegible.

A letter addressed in all probability to William Herbert who came of. age in 1630, and was slain at
Edgehill in 1642. The heir ot· the Van who was learning Welsh was probably William, son of Lady
Beauehamp, whose husband died in 1630. Charles son of Sir Nicholas Kemeys would be about 27 at the
date of this letter, and might therefore be described as ‘the heir of Oefn Mably.' [See Genealogies of
Glamorgan] william Herbert as Lord of Roath Tewkesbury had the gift of the Vicarage of Roath,
for which it seems Gamage was a candidate, as well as Mr. Poughnell upon whom he is so severe.
