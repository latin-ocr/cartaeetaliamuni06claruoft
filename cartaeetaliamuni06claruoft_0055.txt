for the Q. then only one office founde vpon the death of Sir THOMAS STRADLmG,
which I heere is extant of record, and my lord alleageth three seuerall offices for
himself which 310 like to cary as great creadit as th'other . And it may stand
very well that howe be it theris a Seig. of GLAMORGAN and that the Gastell of
CARDIF did hould of hit, yet PENLLINE may hould of CARDIF as meane and not
immediatly of GLAMORG AN, which seemeth some what probable in that (besides
thoffices found for my lord) in the ministers Accomptes (which I suppose was
taken of all the particular manours that wear houlden of GLAMORGAN) there is
no menc'on made of PENLmNE, LANGAN and COSTON‚ wherby colorably
may be gathered that they wear not houlden immediatly of GLAMORGAN
which my lord may affirme 10 110 1110 Castell of CARDIFF . But wher
but of some other L. meane betwine hit and GLAMORGAN you seeme to
avoid the credit of thoffices found for my lord, by alleaging that his
owne servauntes and such as wear at his comaundement had all the
dealinges therein (what soeuer men by discretion will conceave) I take
the lawe will make no accompt thereos, for an office found by th’othe of
xm. men was allwaies of such force that if the kinges tenaunt wear found to
haue died seised, and his heire within age, though in truth the heire wear aboue
XL. years ould, yit by the Gomon lawe he could not by any 111031103 avoid the
office, but should remaine in ward till that according to the office he had perem-
plished his full age. And whereas you alleage that, wher aboue 40 manours
wear found at once by inquisic'on to be houlden of the Queem, the ould Earle
procured supersedeas and 30 staied the return thereos, admitting hit to 110 11110
(which resteth as yet to be proved) vnles you can prove that PENLLINE was
especially named with the rest, you can take no advantadg therof. So that (as
I haue said) that one office is th' only ancrehould you have, which must be con-
fessed to be of some force, in that my L. must be driven to trauers hit before he
can maintaine his title, which I think he shall hardly do for any thing I heere,

and therefore it behoveth you to gather what proffes you can in affirmance
