This Will, of which part is here given in full, and of part an abstraet, only, is curious from its antique
and obsolete phraseology, and for the light it throws upon the descent of landed property, and upon the
pedigree of a branch of an important county family.

Edward Mansess. the testator, represented a bmnch of the Mansells of Margam not to be found in the
usual pedigrees of that family.

Thomas. whose name appears among his remainder men, was son and heir of Sir Edward Mansess of
Margam, third baronet. Thomas, of Briton Ferry, was son of Thomas, son of Thomas. son of Bussy,
son of Arthur Mansell of Briton Ferry, who was fourth son of Sir Thomas Mansell of Mai-gam.
