This Manor belonged to the Mansells ; it does not appear whether it was a part of the Margam Abbey
estate, or whether the Mansells purchased it from the Llewellin family.

The only parish bearing the name in the lordship of Glamorgan is in the north-west of the County,
and the description shows that it has nothing to do with this presentment.

The description of the manor places it between the Mauors of Oourt Colman on the east, of Keven
Kribor on the north, of Laleston on the south. It also states that it abuts upon the Parish of Newcassle
on the east, south, and north sides, and on the Parish of Laleston on the west, and partly on the north
and south sides.

The only names given in the presentment that have been identified with those on the ordnance map are
Oourt Colman, Keven Kribor, Keven Ghzse, and Yr Heu Eglwys, all of which are in Newcastle Parish,
and Llangewydd Courte, the Mansion House, which is in Laleston‚ though the lands attributed to it are
mostly in Newcastle. The Manor House for some time a ruin has recently been taken down. The brook
in the presentment called the ‘ Vornwcke‚' is now the Ffornwg. It rises between Pyle and Stormy, runs
eastward below Oourt Colman, and falls into the Ogmore about a mile above Bridgend.

Llangewydd Court was long held by a family of Llewellin, descended from J est yn ap Gwrgan, and of
whom there are two monuments in Laleston Church.

Llangewi is frequently mentioned in these Charters.
