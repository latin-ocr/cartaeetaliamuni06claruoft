LETTER OF WILLIAM GAMAGE TO WILLIAM HERBERT.

[CARDIFF CASTLE Rssconns]
1637—1641.

· Sr The maner is with manie evy new yeare to pr’sent gifts correspondent to the
Time, all new some good, but before the season at the end of ye old yeare I send
y‘ worship heere a little poore gift but good: the A B C of our ancient copious
learned British Tongue. ALEXANDER made much of his ILIAD‚ CESAR of his

MABLY intends it att his coming-e to the country move and persuade you: as for

better guide I will undertake to teach in 9 daies, happily in 9 houres considering
yr worship's capablenes. I heare Mr. POUGHNELL y¹⁵ willingly would be y‘
