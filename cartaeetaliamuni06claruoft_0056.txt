theros, for if you must grant that the land is houlden of th erle then I see not
wherunto you may trust to avoid the wardship, for it is very cleare that the same
land may be houlden in chivalry by escuadg’ and rent, but wher the service of
escuadg is converted to a rent, then by LITLEToN's ground it is a tenure in
soceadge.

As for your wardeilver, it is so rare a terme in the lawe, that I neither knowe,
nor as yet can learne what it is, save by likelihod according to the etimology of
the word it tendeth more in affirmance of knightes service then Soccadg‚ for
seeing the lawe geueth no ward to the lord in Soccadg I see not howe any money
should be paied for the same . But do rather immagine that wardsilver was an
yearly considerac'on geuen to the lord by composic’on to forbeare his ward
when it should fall. But howe soeuer it be there is no reason that the receaving
of any money which is but a matter in fact, should worke any conclusion against

thoffices which are of record.
