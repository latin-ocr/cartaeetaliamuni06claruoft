The Manor of Ogmore of which the boundaries are here described in great detail are happily those of
parishes, to which their identification is due, since most of the names in the survey, often those of tenants,
are lost beyond recovery.

It is composed of two distinct portions, one upon the sea shore, the other in the mountainous region
considerably to the north, among the head waters of the ngr and its tributaries.

The smaller but more important portion commencing at the mouth of the ngr upon the sea shore has
the mid stream of the river for its boundary as far up as the influx of the Ewenny on its left bank, up
which stream it ascends to the bridge⁷ and thence by nynon fawr and Eeronston above which it rejoins
the Ewenny to opposite Watertown, whence it proceeds south-eastward by Brocastle to the Golden Mile,
where crossing the road it descende southward by Gelli and Claypit to Parem, or Perffla, where it crosses
the Alun to Pieket, Monkton, Broughton, and thence by Clawdd-y-Mynach to the sea, and so along· the
shore four miles to the mouth of the ngr. This portion contains the parishes of St. Brides, Ewenny,
Wick, and the hamlet of Lampha. In it also are the remains of the Norman keep of Ogmore Castle and
a fragment of the Court-house where the manor courts, Leet and Baron, are still held. Within it also is
the modern house representing the old castle of Dunraven, the seat of the old families of Butler and
Vaughan, and afterwards by purchase of the Wyndhams. It was held of the manor by military tenure.
Both castles are in St. Brides Parish, and in the Church is a good Butler monument with an effigy.

The other and far lai-ger portion of the Manor lies on high ground north of Bridgend. Commencing
at the junction of the Llynfi with the ngr the boundary ascends the latter river to its reception of the
Garw at Abergarw, and thence to the influx of the ngr Fach along which it proceeds eastward to
Melin Cruglas (Glaig las) and thence follows the course of the same stream to Crug—yr-Atow, whence it
takes the high mountain ridge to Bwlch Garw, and thence south-westward to the head of the Llynfi and
down that stream southwards to its junction with the ngr.

In the tract thus enclosed are the parishes of Glyn ngr or Llandyfodwg, Llangeinwyr‚ and Bettws,
and the hamlet of Ynysawdre 3 the boundaries are all those of these parishes, and the hamlet. Corntown
and Lampha are Mauors held by Knight’s service of Ogmore. Ewenny and Colwinston since the
dissolution are Manors held ‘in capite de corona’ of Ogmore.

The part of N ash included in Ogmore belongs to the Manor of Nash‚ but the tenants attend the manor
courts and claim privileges as tenants of the manor. There are many commons on which the contiguous
tenants exerc-ise common of pasture, those in the hill portione are very extensive. Oustomary lands
descend by Borough English to the youngest son, or failing sons, to the youngest daughter or other
kinswoman. The widow had her estate in such customary lands as her husband died seized of. A man
marrying an heiress ceases to be tenant by the custom after the death of his wife, even if they have issue,
but the heir when of age steps in. There is no wardship⁷ and the heir is of age at 16. Other customs and

usages are set forth in the text. Ogmore was a part of the de Londres estate, and descended through the
Chaworths to the Dukes of Lancaster⁷ and still belongs to the Duchy.
